// The TxnCommit multiplier adapts tests to cover the commiting of a single transaction.
//
// It will ensure that any write actions are reflected within the transaction scope pre-commit,
// and will ensure that those writes are later persisted in the backing store after transaction
// commit.
//
// It does this by:
//   - Creating a new new transaction immediately after the last [action.NewNode] action.
//   - Scoping any following actions to the new transaction.
//   - Creating a [action.TxnCommit] action to commit the transaction.
//   - Duplicating the original read actions occuring after the last write action to re-execute them
//     outside of the transaction scope following commit.
//
// Whether or not an action is a 'read' or 'write' is currently handled by switches within this
// implementation, new action types will need to amend these switches should they wish to take
// advantage of this multiplier.  Long term we should find a better solution.
